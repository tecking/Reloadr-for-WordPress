# Reloadr for WordPress

## What's this?

A plugin for WordPress.

This is based on "Reloadr" which watches web project files for change, and refreshes their page automatically. This is good for client-side assets(e.g. *.css) and server-side assets(e.g. *.php). 

Awesome scripts "Reloadr" were made by Daniel Bergey(https://github.com/dbergey). Please see also [the "Reloadr" site](https://github.com/dbergey/Reloadr).

## Installation

1. Download plugin archive and expand.
2. Upload to your plugin's directory and activate the plugin.
3. On "Settings > Reloadr" page, set some options.
